\description{
We can store several types of statistics from an experiment
  measuring one variable. These include minimum, mean, median, mode, and
  maximum as well as standard deviation. There are several sanity constraints
  imposed on them, e.g., the minimum cannot be bigger than the maximum and if
  the standard deviation is 0 they must be the same, etc. Here we try to
  generate "column names" and conditions for a given variable.
